**NOTES**

These files describe the parameters for different analysis sets. Which parameter set to use is determined in `run.R`.
Each file generates an `analysis.parameters` list where each element is a named list of a set of parameters. Please
note the name of the analysis must be file path friendly as `run.R` will use it to generate a folder name in `results/`.
