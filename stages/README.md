**NOTES**

These scripts run independently. They are executed via the `run.R` and `setup.R`
scripts found in the parent directory. All stages can be run independently of
`run.R` and `setup.R`. I recommend running them via command-line and logging
their results:
```{bash}
Rscript [name_of_stage].R > [name_of_log_file].txt 2>&1 &
```

*clade.R*:
Model trees from simulated trees using the same parameters. Record trees every
1/100 time step in order to chart the success of clades through time.
(Run independently of `run.R` and `setup.R`.)

*compare.R*:
Analyses the results generated by all previous stages, figures are produced as
they are found in the publication.

*download.R*:
Searches `TreeBase` for all suitable trees and downloads them to
`data/raw_trees/treebase`.

*model.R*:
Models trees according to parameters specified in `run.R`.

*parse.R*:
Parses trees found in `data/raw_trees/treebase` and
`data/raw_trees/literature`. Parsed trees are written to `data/parsed_trees`.

*precalculate.R*:
Calculates tree shape statistics of trees in parsed trees for analysis at the
compare stage.

*taxonomise.R*:
Search and identify taxonomic identities of trees in `data/parsed_trees`.
(Run independently of `run.R` and `setup.R`.)
